The Odin Project Project Landing

This is the start of the independent project of The Odin-Project, Project Landing. We are starting with guidelines of how the page should look (sections) and the parameters (fonts, colors, etc.) of the project.

This project will showcase my attempt to keep within those boundaries , making the best page possible. I hope you enjoy it!
